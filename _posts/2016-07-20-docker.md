#### About Docker

Docker is a [container technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) that provides a **layer of abstraction** on the OS that it is installed on(Linux or Windows). It allows the packaging of a software application into a **image** which consists of everything the software requires to run: code, system utilities, third party libraries and other dependencies. Then this image is run on the common **layer of abstraction** defined above. Therefore, it becomes easy to move and deploy the software application (which refers to the **container**) across any infrastructure or environment.

#### Pre-requisites:

  * Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit version. (Docker does not run on 32 bit)
  * Kernel version 3.10 and above. Check current kernel version using uname -r

* * *

#### Installation

##### The Easy Way

  <code>wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh</code>

OR

##### The Longer Way (in case the easy way doesn't work out)

  1. Update APT sources & enable APT to work with HTTPS:
      * <code>apt-get update</code>
      
      * <code>sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common</code>
      

  2. Add the GPG keys:
      * <code> curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - </code>

  3. Add the stable repository to the apt sources list:
      * <code>sudo add-apt-repository \   
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"</code>
  4. Update apt resource list: 
      * <code>apt-get update</code>
  5. Install Docker Community Edition
      * <code>apt-get install docker-ce</code>

* * *

#### Running Docker

  1. Start Docker and test if it installed correctly. The second command will download the "hello-world" image form DockerHub, create a container and run it.
      * <code>service docker start</code>
      * <code>docker run hello-world</code>
      
  2. To view all the containers on the system, type:
      * <code>docker ps -a</code>
      
  3. Try downloading and running the whalesay image from DockerHub. In order to do this, first create an account on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and search for the image docker/whalesay. On the image page, you'll find instructions on usage. For whalesay, use the following command 
      * <code>docker run docker/whalesay cowsay boo</code>

  4. After the image downloads and runs, you'll see the input in the form of a ASCII whale with a "boo" caption. Not very profound, I know. You can play around with the image by passing different parameters. Say:
      * <code>docker run docker/whalesay cowsay skywide!</code>
      

  5. In order to view all the images on the system, type:
      * <code>docker images</code>
      
  6. We'll next learn how to build your own images. For now, use the above whalesay image and modify it to create our new image

* * *

#### Creating your own Docker image

  1. Create a directory skywide.
  2. CD into the directory
  3. Create a file Dockerfile
      * <code>touch Dockerfile</code>
     
  4. Open Dockerfile in an editor and add the following.:
      * <code>FROM: docker/whalesay:latest</code>
      * <code>RUN: apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y fortunes</code>
      * <code>CMD: /usr/games/fortune -a | cowsay </code>


  5. The FROM command tells Docker which image your image is based on. RUN command tells Docker to install the required programs/libraries on your image. CMD tells Docker to run the specified command when the image is run inside a container.
  6. Next, build your image by running:
      * <code>docker build -t docker-whale .</code>
      
       The docker build command requires a Dockerfile to be present in the current directory. The "-t" option gives a name to the image being built (in this case, it is "docker-whale")
  7. Docker will build a new image by using the whalesay image that it downloaded earlier and on this new image it will update the apt-get cache and install the software fortunes.
  8. You can then verify that a new image has been built by running docker images. You should now see three images including "docker-whale".
  9. Finally, see your own image in action! Go ahead and run:
      * <code>docker run docker-whale</code>
      
* * *

#### Pushing your image to DockerHub

  1. Create a new repository to upload your docker image to. Make sure the repository is public
  2. Note down the image ID from 
      * <code>docker images</code>
  3. Tag your image with your username
      * <code>docker tag (image-id) (dockerhub-username) (repository-name):latest</code>
  4. Type docker images again to see your new tagged image
  5. You will need to login to Docker from the terminal before you can push it. To login
      * <code>docker login --username=(username) --email=(docker-email)</code>
  6. To push the image to your repo, type
      * <code>docker push (username)/(image-name)</code>
  7. Finally, after the command finishes running, go to your DockerHub repository page to find your uploaded image.
